# RegistrationPage

This project contains Cypress automation tests for a sign-up page, as well as Jest unit tests for the same.

## Overview

The Cypress automation tests in `createAccount.cy.js` validate the functionality of the sign-up page by simulating user interactions and verifying expected outcomes. These tests can be executed using the Cypress Test Runner.

The Jest unit tests in `createAccount.test.js` focus on testing individual functions or components of the sign-up page in isolation, ensuring their correctness. These tests can be run using the Jest testing framework.
